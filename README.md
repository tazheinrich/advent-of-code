# Advent of Code 

[Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) is a yearly event featuring holiday-themed programming puzzles released daily from December 1st to 25th, following the Advent calendar format. Launched in 2015, it has become a popular challenge for programmers of all levels.

Each puzzle can be solved in any programming language and often requires a mix of problem-solving, algorithm design, and creative thinking. Participants can track their progress and compete for the fastest solutions on global and private leaderboards.

## Participation

I'm not here to win Advent of Code or climb the leaderboard ‚Äî I use the puzzles more like a coding gym. It's my excuse to learn a new programming language, stretch my brain a bit, and knock the dust off some long-forgotten syntax. I add solutions whenever I get around to them, so don't expect a complete set ‚Äî this is more of a "whenever-I-feel-like-it" kind of thing than a daily grind.
